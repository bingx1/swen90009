#### Ask for permission to record
#### State current understanding of project
	- Motivation: Canvas LMS exists, but client wants a dashboard for how accessing, interacting and performing
	- Developing a dashboard on canvas
	- Analytics and core functionality
	- Only users: students?
#### Reconcile differences

#### Ask questions

	- How does the system fit into the needs of the business?
	- How is the product to be used on a day to day basis?

##### What is H5P exactly?
	- H5P makes widgets. Investigate and decide to use it or not
##### What do we need to do, and what do we not need to do? (scope)
##### How much of H5P do they prefer us to use? preferences for tools?
##### What does self reflecting include? 
##### How is that going to reflect in the analytics? 
##### What performance metrics do we gather from the student? 
##### How do we process it?
##### What is the output?
##### Are we just doing the UI?
##### Does the client have any preferences to how the students will interact with the dashboard?
##### How much customizability will the dashboard require?
##### Ask if he could provide us with scenarios for each potential user
##### Take notes


### Notes:
#### Paula
	- psychology, learn how to use tech to better support students
	- interested to know how students behaviours impact performance
	- learning analytics - audit logs that LMS records, canvas records every click you do when you log in
	- interested in: struggling students vs motivated vs need help on quiz?
#### Role

##### Student
	- Create dashboard for students (undergrads) to look at data from LMS -> reflect on learning & make decisions on learning
	- contribution to different things online, student can see that they visited discussion board “n” number of times -> optimise
	- dashboard showing the way you interact with data on canvas, students can only see our own data (private)
		- how many times clicked on system
		- how long stayed
		- videos downloaded
		- etc
	- self-regulated learning (plan, monitor, regulate learning)
		- gathering data from all subjects student take
		- self-reflection

##### Teacher
	- need interface for teachers as well
	- go online for LMS and activate/deactivate dashboard for subject
		- data
		- interaction with discussion board
		- feedback for students - would students access quiz

#### H5P
	- H5P makes widgets. Investigate and decide to use it or not

#### Canvas API
	- use postman to check feasiblility
